#SweatMap
Take in a series of UTF-8 strings and map them to UTF-8 strings that are as small as possible while still being unique.

###Why?
The motivation behind SweatMap was to take semantic CSS Identifiers (e.g. for selectors) and make them as small as possible at build time. With new tools that can take advantage of CSS Modules all we needed was something to map our current class names to something smaller.

##Installation
`npm install sweatmap --save`

##How to use
Coming soon, but source is pretty simple to read.
